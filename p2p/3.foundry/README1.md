## Introduction

Ethereum has introduced a major revolution in the blockchain world: smart-contracts.
Smart-contracts rely on blockchain technology to guarantee their integrity and inviolability.
They are irrevocable computer programs, most often deployed on a blockchain,
which execute a set of pre-defined instructions. Developing smart-contracts is way more different 
from developing a regular application.

## Step 0 - Setup

Please refer to the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) file.

## Step 1 - Forge is useful to test

### :bookmark_tabs: **Description**:

In this step you will learn how to use foundry to test your contracts.
Before starting take a look at the generated files, specially in the `src/` & `test/` folders.
In the `src/` folder you will find the `Counter.sol` file, this is the contract you will be working on.



### :pushpin: **Tasks**:

- Add a constructor to the contract, it will be used to initialize the number value. 
    - The constructor must take a `uint256` as an argument.


- Modify the `increment` function to make it increase the value of `number` by the value passed as an argument.
    - The function must also take a `uint256` as an argument.

  
- Now test your function by modifying the `test/Counter.t.sol` file, the file must test the `increment` function and the `setNumber` one.
    - You can use the `forge test` command at the root of your project to test your contract.

> :attention: Take care about the visibility of your functions !

### :books: **Documentation**:

- [functions and constructor](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/contracts.html)
- [test with forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests)
- [visibility](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/contracts.html#function-visibility)

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Validation**:

```shell
Running 2 tests for test/Counter.t.sol:CounterTest
[PASS] testIncrement() (gas: 28312)
[PASS] testSetNumber(uint256) (runs: 256, Œº: 26676, ~: 28387)
Test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; finished in 12.26ms
```

## Step 2 - Forge is also useful to deploy & call is useful to interact with contracts

### :bookmark_tabs: **Description**:

In this step we'll use the `anvil` command to start a local test blockchain. We will
use it to deploy our contract and interact with it.

### :pushpin: **Tasks**:

- Start the local blockchain with `anvil`
    - This will start a local blockchain on your computer, and give you some key pairs to interact with it.
 
 
- Deploy your contract on the local blockchain.
    - You can use `forge` to deploy your contract.

> You will use the retrieved address to interact with your contract in the following parts.

- Call the contract to query the value of `number`.
    - You can use `cast` to query read-only function of your contract.

> In Solidity when you declare a variable as `public` it will automatically generate a getter function for you.
> So you can access the value of `number` by calling `number()`.

- Call the contract to set the value of `number` to 4242
  - You can also use `cast` to call a function of your contract.


### :books: **Documentation**:

- [anvil specifications](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/)
- [use forge to deploy](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/deploying)
- [use cast to interact with contracts](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cast/)

### ‚úîÔ∏è **Validation**:

After sending the transaction to modify the value of number you should see a similar output:

```shell
blockHash               0x4f9d29ee882ad03ff9f160628a32ed6cd965198e458d00d350240bdea8a7f121
blockNumber             4
cumulativeGasUsed       26394
effectiveGasPrice       3588267222
gasUsed                 26394
logs                    []
status                  1
transactionHash         0x509fd1fde780cfae293155a32dfa24c16bff2d4fb48a360050dbe7f965532985
transactionIndex        0
```
> you can also test by querying again the value of `number` and see if it has been modified.
